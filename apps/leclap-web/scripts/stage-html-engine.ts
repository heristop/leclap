// Stages the HTML layer rasteriser's WebAssembly (resvg and HarfBuzz's subsetter) into
// public/html-engine/<version>/ before `vite` runs (dev and build), so the builder's live preview and the
// browser render fetch it from this origin rather than a CDN: see src/infrastructure/html-engine.ts, which
// loads it. Satori needs no file of its own (its Yoga build is inlined in its JS, which Vite bundles).
//
// The versions are the engine's (HTML_WASM_FILES), and the installed packages have to match them. Both files
// are small (~2.4 MB and ~0.6 MB), far under the 25 MiB Cloudflare Pages takes per file, so they ship as is.
//
// Runs as plain `node scripts/stage-html-engine.ts`, hence the `.ts` extension on the engine import.
