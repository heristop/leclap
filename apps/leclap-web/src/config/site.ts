// and the build-time prerender script — reads it from here instead of restating it.
//
// Two module systems import this file, which constrains what may go in it:
//   • app code            `@/config/site`            (Vite / Vitest, via the alias)
//   • the prerender step  `../src/config/site.ts`    (plain `node scripts/seo-prerender.ts`)
//
// Node runs that script through type-stripping, which applies neither tsconfig path mapping nor
// extensionless resolution — hence the explicit `.ts` specifier there, and hence the rules here:
// no runtime imports, no DOM, and erasable syntax only (no enum, no namespace, no parameter
// properties). Nothing checks that statically; the build does, by running Node straight at it.
