# Materializes the assets a manifest describes from a prebuilt bundle over plain HTTPS, replacing the
# checkout's Git LFS pointer files. Fetching a bundle keeps CI and deploys off the Git LFS bandwidth
# budget, which this repo has exhausted: LFS downloads return 403, and `git lfs pull` reports success
# while materializing nothing.
#
# Every asset is checked before and after the fetch. An earlier version trusted a single sentinel file,
# so a checkout where only *some* media was real skipped the fetch and the build silently shipped
# pointer files in place of videos. Content is checked too, not just "is not a pointer": a truncated or
# stale bundle extracts cleanly and would otherwise surface as an opaque FFmpeg decode error.
